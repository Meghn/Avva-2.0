Unfortunately, viruses, bacteria and other sources of illness do not discriminate based on profession. Here’s what’s in my toolkit to keep us going in sickness and in health.\\n\\nNatural remedies for cough and sore throat\\n------------------------------------------\\n\\n*   Tea – teas with ingredients like licorice and slippery elm have throat-coating properties that help reduce irritation.\\n*   Honey – its throat-coating properties can soothe sore throats and suppress coughs. Have some on a spoon or stir it into tea.\\n*   Echinacea* – can reduce the duration of cold symptoms, particularly if used during the first day or two. It is available as tea, drops or pills.\\n*   Elderberry syrup* – has antiviral properties, making it helpful for colds and influenza. Follow dosing on the package. \\n*   Pelargonium* – a plant used in some natural cold/cough remedies. It shortens the duration and severity of colds. \\n\\n_*Try each of these individually and see which you like best; don’t use all three together._\\n\\n_[![Image 18: Need more than home remedies? Start an online visit](https://www.allinahealth.org/-/media/hsg-images/need-more-than-home-remedies.jpg?la=en&hash=5174193E9B8FEDB279B0A396BD3BBECC)](https://onlinevisit.allinahealth.org/)_\\n\\nDigestive home remedies\\n-----------------------\\n\\n*   Ginger – helpful for upset stomach, nausea and motion sickness. Available as a tea (look for medicinal brands), or try candied ginger when you’re on the go. \\n*   Probiotics – live bacteria and yeasts that are good for your digestive system. Probiotics can help with diarrhea caused by infections or related to antibiotic use. Available as supplements and in foods like yogurt, miso paste, kombucha, kimchi and raw sauerkraut.\\n\\nTopical products for soreness and skin irritation\\n-------------------------------------------------\\n\\n*   Arnica cream – sooths muscle aches, pains and bruising.\\n*   Tea tree oil – an anti-inflammatory agent for bacterial or fungus infections. Use it for spot treatment of acne and for athlete’s foot.\\n*   Calendula – soothes skin irritations like eczema and diaper rash. \\n\\nNatural remedies for sleep\\n--------------------------\\n\\n*   Tea – try chamomile tea in the evening as you are winding down.\\n*   Lavender – an aromatherapy oil used for calming and relaxation. Safe for both young children and older adults.\\n\\nNatural remedies for anxiety\\n----------------------------\\n\\n*   Set aside five minutes before starting your day for slow, deep breathing. Think about the day ahead, what you are grateful for and the people in your life\\n*   On the way to school, teach your kids to use breathing exercises to help them prepare for the day ahead. Slow down breathing by inhaling for four seconds and exhaling for six seconds. This activates the part of the nervous system that calms us. \\n*   Choose calming music to listen to on your way to and from work or school. \\n*   Spend a few minutes after work to prepare for the transition home. Put to rest the unresolved issues at work and shift your focus to your family. \\n\\n**A note about safety:** Tell your doctor about any herbal remedies or supplements you are taking. Consult your doctor before adding herbal remedies if you are pregnant, breastfeeding or taking prescription medications.\\n\\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\\n\\n*   Integrative approach to care\\n\\n[Find a

These are not always supported by research. But, scientists suggest that some may indeed work.\\n\\n![Image 27: Wooden spoons with various herbs](https://i0.wp.com/post.healthline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Spoons_Spices_1296x728-header.jpg?h=1528)\\n\\nChances are you’ve used a home remedy at some point: herbal teas for a cold, essential oils to dull a headache, plant-based supplements for a better night’s sleep. Maybe it was your grandma or you read about it online. The point is you tried it — and perhaps now you’re thinking, “Should I try it again?”\\n\\nIt’s not clear exactly what makes a home remedy do the trick. Is it an actual physiological change in the body or more of a placebo effect? Thankfully, in recent decades, scientists have been asking the same questions in a lab, and are finding that some of our plant-based remedies aren’t just old wives’ tales.\\n\\nAnd so, for the skeptic who needs more than a placebo to feel well, we got your back. Here are the home remedies backed by science:\\n\\nTurmeric for pain and inflammation\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nWho hasn’t heard of turmeric by now? Turmeric has been used, primarily in South Asia as a part of Ayurvedic medicine, for almost 4,000 years. When it comes to proven medicinal purposes, the golden spice may be best for treating pain — [specifically pain associated with inflammation](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/top-10-evidence-based-health-benefits-of-turmeric).\\n\\nSeveral studies have found that curcumin is responsible for turmeric’s “wow” factor. In one study, people with [arthritis pain Trusted Source](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ptr.4639) noted that their pain levels were more reduced after taking 500 milligrams (mg) of curcumin than 50 mg of diclofenac sodium, an anti-inflammatory drug.\\n\\nOther [studies Trusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5664031/) back up this pain relief claim as well, noting that turmeric extract was as effective as ibuprofen for [treating pain Trusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3964021/) in patients with knee osteoarthritis.\\n\\nDon’t go grinding turmeric — which stains heavily! — for immediate relief though. The amount of [curcumin in turmeric is at most 3 percent](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4d3b/a1940d7450769fd59cdeacd7550288bebe71.pdf), meaning you’re better off taking curcumin supplements for relief.\\n\\nThat’s not to say a [soothing turmeric latte won’t help](https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/turmeric-tea-latte-golden). It’s suggested that 2 to 5 grams (g) of the spice may still provide some benefits. Just be sure you add black pepper to boost the absorption.\\n\\n### Drink a cup per day\\n\\nTurmeric is about the long game. Consuming 1/2 to 1 1/2 tsp. of turmeric per day should start providing noticeable benefits after four to eight weeks.\\n\\nChili peppers for pain and soreness\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\nThis active component of chili peppers has a long history of use in folk medicine and has slowly become more accepted outside of homeopathy. Now, capsaicin is a popular topical ingredient for managing pain. It works by causing an area of the skin to get hot, before eventually turning numb.\\n\\nToday, you can get a prescription capsaicin patch called Qutenza, which relies on very high level of capsaicin — [8 percent Trusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3169333/) — to work.\\n\\nSo, when it comes to sore muscles or generalized body pain that won’t leave you alone, and you have some hot peppers or cayenne pepper on hand? Make some capsaicin cream.\\n\\n### DIY capsaicin coconut oil cream\\n\\n1.   Mix 3 tbsp. of cayenne powder with 1 cup of coconut.\\n2.   Heat the oil on a low simmer until it melts.\\n3.   Stir the mixture thoroughly for 5 minutes.\\n4.   Remove from heat and pour into a bowl. Let it firm up.\\n5.   Massage onto skin when cooled.\\n\\nFor an extra fancy feel, whip your coconut oil with a hand mixer so that it becomes light and fluffy.\\n\\nIt’s important to test your reaction to the compound before using too extensively. You may also use jalapeño peppers, but the amount of heat may vary depending on the pepper. Never use this cream around the face or eyes, and be sure to wear gloves during application.\\n\\n[![Image 28: LEARN MORE](https://i0.wp.com/healthline-activation-prod.healthline.com/driver-images/Nurx%20Skincare%20Mailbox.png?)](https://nurx.pxf.io/XxGJeo?rvo_aff=1&rvo_brandid=Nurx&rvo_campaignid=3986&rvo_prodid=650211b8-978e-4bd4-a5f9-a06901bae459&rvo_subid=e%3Acommerce_s%3Ahl_p%3Anurx_n%3Ageneralhealth_l%3Afq_i%3Asdapi_v%3Aacne_46453&rvo_subid2=%2Fhealth%2Fhome-remedies&subid1=e%3Acommerce_s%3Ahl_p%3Anurx_n%3Ageneralhealth_l%3Afq_i%3Asdapi_v%3Aacne_46453&subid2=%2Fhealth%2Fhome-remedies&subid3=93ba0217-e97c-4fbd-b805-f525de8a440f&rvo_sys=mar&noFollowParam=1)\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nGet tretinoin prescribed online and delivered for free\\n\\nThis dermatologist-recommended acne medication may help with hyperpigmentation and graceful aging.

Making a [cup is pretty standard](https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/benefits-ginger-tea): Grate it in your tea for a stronger effect. But the other benefit of ginger that goes less noticed is its effectiveness as an anti-inflammatory.\\n\\nThe next time you feel a little queasy _and_ have a headache, [try ginger](https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/ginger-breakfast#1). Ginger works differently than other pain relievers that target inflammation. It blocks the formation of certain types of inflammatory compounds and breaks down existing inflammation through an antioxidant that interacts with acidity in the fluid between joints. Its [anti-inflammatory effects Trusted Source](https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-015-0038-8) come without the risks of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\\n\\n### Ginger tea recipe\\n\\n1.   Grate half an inch of raw ginger.\\n2.   Boil 2 cups of water and pour over ginger.\\n3.   Let sit for 5 to 10 minutes.\\n4.   Add juice from a lemon, and add honey or agave nectar to taste.\\n\\nShiitake mushrooms for the long game\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nLentinan, also known as AHCC or active hexose correlated compound, is an extract of [shiitake mushrooms](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/shiitake-mushrooms). It promotes [antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects Trusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29473282) at a cellular level.\\n\\nA [petri dish study Trusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18242970) suggests that AHCC can help with inhibiting breast cancer cells, and its interaction with the immune system [might help fight cancer Trusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12470439) by improving chemo-weakened immune systems.\\n\\nIf you’ve found bone broth to be comforting, throw in a few chopped shiitake mushrooms next time. One [study Trusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25866155) found that eating 5 to 10 g of shiitake mushrooms every day helped boost human immune systems after four weeks.\\n\\nEucalyptus oil for pain relief\\n------------------------------\\n\\nEucalyptus oil has a component called 1,8-cineole, which may help relieve pain. The component has a morphine-like effect [when tested on mice Trusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10861965).\\n\\nAnd for the essential oils fans, you’re in luck. Eucalyptus oil has been [shown to relieve body pains even after inhalation](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2013/502727/abs/). For lovers of Vick’s VapoRub, who have been inhaling it as a home remedy for congestion, well, eucalyptus oil is your magic ingredient.\\n\\nHowever, inhaling eucalyptus oil isn’t for everyone. This oil can trigger asthma and may be harmful to pets. It may also lead to respiratory distress in infants.\\n\\nLavender for migraine and anxiety\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nMigraine attacks, headaches, anxiety, and general feelings of (dis)stress? Inhaling [lavender can help with that](https://www.healthline.com/health/lavender-history-plant-care-types). Studies shows that lavender helps with:\\n\\n*   [migraine](https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/335249)\\n*   [lowering anxiety or restlessness](https://academic.oup.com/ijnp/article/17/6/859/691858)\\n*   [memory troubles when stressed and sleep Trusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3612440/)\\n\\nDrinking lavender tea or keeping a satchel around for times of high stress is one way to reduce anxiety and relax the mind and body.\\n\\nAs an essential oil, it can also be combined with other plant oils for aromatherapy. One [study Trusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16884344) found that in combination with sage and rose, lavender was helpful in relieving premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms.\\n\\n> **Caution**\\n> While lavender is a powerful plant, it can come with side effects. Directly applying essential oil without diluting it may irritate the skin or potentially affect hormone levels. Always diffuse and dilute essential oils before use.\\n\\nMint for muscle pain and digestion\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nMint, as common as it sounds, isn’t simple. Depending on the type, it can provide different uses and benefits.\\n\\nFor pain, you’ll want to look for wintergreen, which has methyl salicylate, a compound that may work similarly to capsaicin. Applying it can feel like a cool “burn” before the numbing effect takes place. This effect helps with joint and muscle pain.\\n\\nThe other mint type that’s commonly used in folk medicine is peppermint. An ingredient in many different cures, peppermint has been found to be especially effective in helping treat irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms.\\n\\nStudies show that along with fiber, it [helps reduce spasms Trusted Source](https://www.bmj.com/content/337/bmj.a2313), as well as [diarrhea and abdominal pain Trusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23416804) associated with IBS. Peppermint activates an anti-pain channel in the colon, which reduces inflammatory pain in the digestive tract. This most likely accounts for its effectiveness in treating IBS.\\n\\nBeyond digestion and stomach troubles, a peppermint oil capsule or tea [may also help with headaches, colds, and other body discomforts Trusted Source](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/peppermintoil).\\n\\nFenugreek for breastfeeding\\n---------------------------\\n\\nFenugreek seeds are often used in cooking in the Mediterranean and Asia, but this spice, which is similar to cloves, has several medicinal uses.\\n\\nWhen made into a tea, fenugreek can help with [milk production for breastfeeding Trusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21261516). For people experiencing diarrhea, fenugreek is a [great water-soluble fiber Trusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4291444/) to help firm up stools. If you’re constipated, you definitely want to avoid these seeds.\\n\\nAs a supplement, fenugreek has also been [found to lower blood sugar Trusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16379570), making it a popular aid for people with diabetes. Fenugreek’s role here is due in part to its high fiber content, which can [help with improving insulin function Trusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19857068).\\n\\n### Fenugreek in cooking\\n\\nFenugreek is often ground and used in curries, dry rubs, and in teas. You can add it to your yogurt for a small savory taste, or sprinkle it over your salads.\\n\\nMagnesium-rich foods for everything\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\nFeeling muscle pains? Fatigue? More migraine attacks? More likely to slip into a numbed emotional state than usual? It might be a [magnesium deficiency](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/magnesium-deficiency-symptoms). While magnesium is often talked about in terms of the growth and maintenance of bones, it’s also essential in nerve and muscle function.\\n\\nBut studies show that almost half of the U.S. population doesn’t get [their required amount of magnesium Trusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6316205/). So, if you’ve ever complained of these symptoms and got a slightly terse “eat spinach” response in return, know that it’s not completely unfounded.\\n\\nSpinach, almonds, avocados, and even dark chocolate are all rich in magnesium. You don’t necessarily need a supplement to treat magnesium deficiency.\\n\\nWhen it comes to mood, magnesium may also help. Magnesium works with the parasympathetic nervous system, which keeps you calm and relaxed, suggesting that having a [magnesium-rich diet might aid in stress relief.Trusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5452159/)\\n\\n### Foods high in magnesium\\n\\n*   lentils, beans, chickpeas, and peas\\n*   tofu\\n*   whole grains\\n*   fatty fish, like salmon, mackerel, and halibut\\n*   bananas\\n\\nMake sure to use home remedies correctly\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\nWhile most of these [natural remedies](https://www.healthline.com/health/womens-health/yeast-infection-home-remedy) don’t have any significant side effects, they may be harmful if used in excess amounts.\\n\\nCertain people may also be more sensitive to dosage amounts, so if you’re on any medication or live with a condition that’s affected by your diet, talk to a doctor before consuming these foods regularly. And if you have an allergic reaction or worsening symptoms from any home remedy, speak to a doctor right away.\\n\\nKeep in mind that home remedies may not always be safe and effective for you. While these are backed by scientific studies, a single study or clinical trial doesn’t always cover diverse communities or bodies. What research notes as beneficial may not always work for you.\\n\\nMany of the remedies we listed above are ones we grew up with, ones that families have passed down and brought us up on since we were children, and we look forward to falling back on them when we need the comfort.\\n\\nPlants as Medicine\\n------------------\\n\\nPlants as Medicine\\n\\nMeet Kate August, an Herbalist creating bitters to support health.\\n\\n0 seconds of 3 minutes, 18 seconds Volume 0%\\n\\nPress shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcuts\\n\\nKeyboard Shortcuts Enabled Disabled\\n\\nShortcuts Open/Close/ or ?\\n\\nPlay/Pause SPACE\\n\\nIncrease Volume↑\\n\\nDecrease Volume↓\\n\\nSeek Forward→\\n\\nSeek Backward←\\n\\nCaptions On/Off c\\n\\nFullscreen/Exit Fullscreen f\\n\\nMute/Unmute m\\n\\nDecrease Caption Size-\\n\\nIncrease Caption Size+ or =\\n\\nSeek %0-9\\n\\n facebook x Email\\n\\n Link\\n\\nCopied\\n\\nAuto 1080p 720p 406p 270p 180p\\n\\nLive\\n\\n00:00\\n\\n03:18\\n\\n03:18\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n_Rosa Escandón is a New York-based writer and comedian.

Begum,MD](https://www.webmd.com/bio/jabeen-begum) on August 28, 2023\\n\\n![Image 21: Take

Care\\n---------\\n\\nNo matter what you've heard or how badly you want relief, talk with your doctor or pharmacist before trying any home remedy. This is even more important if you take prescription or over-the-counter medications, because some can affect how drugs work. And keep in mind that many don’t have any research to back them up.\\n\\n![Image 22: Peppermint](https://img.lb.wbmdstatic.com/vim/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_tools/home_remedies_slideshow/493ss_thinkstock_rf_herbal_peppermint_and_oil.jpg?resize=728px:*&output-quality=100)\\n\\n**2**/15\\n\\nPeppermint\\n----------\\n\\nMint has been used for hundreds of years as a health remedy. Peppermint oil might help with [irritable bowel syndrome](https://www.webmd.com/ibs/digestive-diseases-irritable-bowel-syndrome) -- a long-term condition that can cause cramps, bloating, gas, [diarrhea](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-diarrhea), and [constipation](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-constipation) -- and it may be good for headaches as well. More studies are needed to see how much it helps and why. People use the leaf for other conditions, too, but there’s very little evidence it helps with any of them.\\n\\n![Image 23: Honey](https://img.lb.wbmdstatic.com/vim/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_tools/home_remedies_slideshow/493ss_thinkstock_rf_jar_of_raw_honey_and_comb.jpg?resize=728px:*&output-quality=100)\\n\\n**3**/15\\n\\nHoney\\n-----\\n\\nThis natural sweetener may work just as well for a cough as over-the-counter medicines. That could be especially helpful for children who aren’t old enough to take those. But don’t give it to an infant or a toddler younger than 1. There’s a small risk of a rare but serious kind of food poisoning that could be dangerous for them. And while you may have heard that “local” [honey](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/manuka-honey-medicinal-uses) can help with allergies, studies don’t back that up.\\n\\n![Image 24: Turmeric](https://img.lb.wbmdstatic.com/vim/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_tools/home_remedies_slideshow/493ss_thinkstock_rf_turmeric_powder_heaps.jpg?resize=728px:*&output-quality=100)\\n\\n**4**/15\\n\\nTurmeric\\n--------\\n\\nThis spice has been hyped as being able to help with a variety of conditions from [arthritis](https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/understanding-arthritis-treatment) to fatty liver. There is some early research to support this. Other claims, such as healing ulcers and helping with skin rashes after radiation are lacking proof. If you try it, don’t overdo it: High doses can cause digestive problems.\\n\\n![Image 25: Ginger](https://img.lb.wbmdstatic.com/vim/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_tools/home_remedies_slideshow/493ss_thinkstock_rf_wooden_spoon_shredded_ginger_root.jpg?resize=728px:*&output-quality=100)\\n\\n**5**/15\\n\\nGinger\\n------\\n\\nIt’s been used for thousands of years in Asian medicine to treat stomachaches, diarrhea, and [nausea](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-nausea-vomiting), and studies show that it works for nausea and vomiting. There’s some evidence that it might help with menstrual cramps, too. But it’s not necessarily good for everyone. Some people get tummy trouble, heartburn, diarrhea, and gas because of it, and it may affect how some medications work. So talk to your doctor, and use it with care.\\n\\n### Featured\\n\\n*   [Ubrogepant: Key Facts for Migraine Relief](https://www.webmd.com/migraines-headaches/cm/things-know-ubrogepant-ubrelvy?mmtrack=21880-40666-17-1-1-0-1) \\n*   [Beating Menstrual Migraines](https://www.webmd.com/migraines-headaches/video/menstrual-migraine?mmtrack=21031-38383-17-1-1-0-2) \\n*   [Causes and Triggers of Migraines](https://www.webmd.com/migraines-headaches/migraines-causes?mmtrack=21155-38736-17-1-1-0-3) \\n\\n![Image 26: Sex](https://img.lb.wbmdstatic.com/vim/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_tools/home_remedies_slideshow/493ss_thinkstock_rf_intimate_african_american_couple.jpg?resize=728px:*&output-quality=100)\\n\\n**6**/15\\n\\nSex\\n---\\n\\nNo more, “Not tonight, Dear.” It turns out that sex can help ease pain when you have certain kinds of headaches -- especially migraines. It’s also been shown to improve heart health, ease stress, and boost mental alertness.\\n\\n![Image 27: Green Tea](https://img.lb.wbmdstatic.com/vim/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_tools/home_remedies_slideshow/493ss_thinkstock_rf_pouring_hot_green_tea_in_ceramic_cup.jpg?resize=728px:*&output-quality=100)\\n\\n**7**/15\\n\\nGreen Tea\\n---------\\n\\nThis comforting drink does more than keep you awake and alert. It’s a great source of some powerful antioxidants that can protect your cells from damage and help you fight disease. It may even lower your odds of heart disease and certain kinds of cancers, like skin, breast, lung, and [colon](https://www.webmd.com/balance/natural-colon-cleansing-is-it-necessary).\\n\\n![Image 28: Garlic](https://img.lb.wbmdstatic.com/vim/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_tools/home_remedies_slideshow/493ss_thinkstock_rf_garlic_bulbs_in_market.jpg?resize=728px:*&output-quality=100)\\n\\n**8**/15\\n\\nGarlic\\n------\\n\\nSome studies show that people who eat more garlic are less likely to get certain types of cancer (garlic supplements don’t seem to have the same effect). It also may lower blood [cholesterol](https://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management/understanding-numbers) and blood pressure levels, but it doesn’t seem to help that much.\\n\\n![Image 29: Chicken Soup](https://img.lb.wbmdstatic.com/vim/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_tools/home_remedies_slideshow/493ss_thinkstock_rf_bowl_chicken_noodle_soup.jpg?resize=728px:*&output-quality=100)\\n\\n**9**/15\\n\\nChicken Soup\\n------------\\n\\nTurns out, Grandma was right: Chicken soup can be good for a cold. Studies show it can ease symptoms and help you get rid of it sooner. It also curbs swelling and clears out nasal fluids.\\n\\n![Image 30: Neti Pot](https://img.lb.wbmdstatic.com/vim/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_tools/home_remedies_slideshow/493ss_thinkstock_rf_neti_pot_with_salt_on_placemat.jpg?resize=728px:*&output-quality=100)\\n\\n**10**/15\\n\\nNeti Pot\\n--------\\n\\nYou put a salt and warm water mixture in something that looks like a little teapot. Then pour it through one nostril and let it drain out the other. You have to practice a little, but once you get the hang of it, it can ease allergy or cold symptoms and may even help you get rid of a cold quicker. Just make sure you use distilled or cooled boiled water and keep your neti pot clean.\\n\\n![Image 31: Cinnamon](https://img.lb.wbmdstatic.com/vim/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_tools/home_remedies_slideshow/493ss_thinkstock_rf_wooden_spoon_cinnamon_spice_and_sticks.jpg?resize=728px:*&output-quality=100)\\n\\n**11**/15\\n\\nCinnamon\\n--------\\n\\nYou may have heard that it can help control blood sugar for people who have prediabetes or diabetes. But there’s no evidence that it does anything for any medical condition. If you plan to try it, be careful: Cinnamon extracts can be bad for your liver in large doses.\\n\\n![Image 32: Hot Bath](https://img.lb.wbmdstatic.com/vim/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_tools/home_remedies_slideshow/493ss_thinkstock_rf_woman_soaking_in_bathtub-1.jpg?resize=728px:*&output-quality=100)\\n\\n**12**/15\\n\\nHot Bath\\n--------\\n\\nIt’s good for all kinds of things that affect your muscles, bones, and tendons (the tissues that connect your muscles to your bones), like arthritis, back pain, and joint pain. And warm water can help get blood flow to areas that need it, so gently stretch and work those areas while you’re in there. But don’t make it too hot, especially if you have a skin condition. The ideal [temperature](https://www.webmd.com/first-aid/normal-body-temperature) is between 92 and 100 F.\\n\\n![Image 33: Ice Pack](https://img.lb.wbmdstatic.com/vim/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_tools/home_remedies_slideshow/493ss_thinkstock_rf_ice_pack_applied_to_arm.jpg?resize=728px:*&output-quality=100)\\n\\n**13**/15\\n\\nIce Pack\\n--------\\n\\nUse a bag of frozen peas or simply a plastic bag or wet towel with ice in the first 48 hours after an injury to help with pain and swelling. You also can use it on injuries that cause pain and swelling over and over again --but only after physical activity, not before. Never use ice for more than 20 minutes, and take it off if your skin gets red.\\n\\n![Image 34: Petroleum Jelly](https://img.lb.wbmdstatic.com/vim/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_tools/home_remedies_slideshow/493ss_thinkstock_rf_fingers_in_used_petroleum_jelly_tin.jpg?resize=728px:*&output-quality=100)\\n\\n**14**/15\\n\\nPetroleum Jelly\\n---------------\\n\\nThis is used for any number of things: It can help your skin keep its moisture and prevent chafing -- on the inside of your thighs when you run, for example. It also can help protect your [baby](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/forming-a-bond-with-your-baby-why-it-isnt-always-immediate)’s skin from diaper rash.\\n\\n### Featured\\n\\n*   [Infusion Therapy for Migraine: What to Expect](https://www.webmd.com/migraines-headaches/cm/migraine-infusion-therapy-what-to-expect?mmtrack=20779-37692-17-1-1-0-1) \\n*   [CGRP Antagonists: Relief and Prevention](https://www.webmd.com/migraines-headaches/nurtec-odt-migraine?mmtrack=21206-38869-17-1-1-0-2) \\n*   [High-Frequency Episodic Migraine: More Than a Bad Headache](https://www.webmd.com/migraines-headaches/what-are-high-frequency-episodic-migraines?mmtrack=22529-41911-17-1-1-0-3) \\n\\n![Image 35: Ear Candling](https://img.lb.wbmdstatic.com/vim/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_tools/home_remedies_slideshow/493ss_thinkstock_rf_woman_having_ear_candling_procedure.jpg?resize=728px:*&output-quality=100)\\n\\n**15**/15\\n\\nEar Candling\\n------------\\n\\nThis is dangerous and doesn’t work -- don’t do it. The idea is, you place the unlit end of a lit, hollow candle into your ear, and that draws out the wax. But several things can go wrong: It can push earwax deeper in, candle wax can get inside your ear, it can puncture your eardrum, or it can burn your ear canal, face, scalp, or hair.

remedies](https://www.piedmont.org/living-real-change/_controls/media/BlogImages/natural-remedies.jpg)\\n\\n9 natural cold and flu remedies\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nDo natural cold and flu remedies really work? Barbara Austin, RN, MN, a nurse and complex case manager at Piedmont Sixty Plus, separates fact from fiction.\\n\\nThe best natural cold and flu remedies\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\n**Hydration**\\n\\nAustin\\'s number one recommendation for recovering quickly from a cold or flu virus is [staying hydrated](https://www.piedmont.org/living-real-change/infographic-water-water-water).\\n\\n\"When [you\\'re hydrated](https://www.piedmont.org/living-real-change/the-truth-about-dehydration), your body has a natural ability to flush germs out of your system,\" she says.\\n\\nShe recommends 64 ounces of fluid a day, but talk to your doctor about your specific needs. Some people, such as those with [congestive heart failure](https://www.piedmont.org/living-real-change/heart-failure-101-treating-and-managing-the-number-one-killer-of-americans), should drink less water.\\n\\n**Vitamin C**\\n\\nWhile [vitamin C](https://www.piedmont.org/living-real-change/infographic-essential-vitamins-and-minerals) hasn\\'t been proven to prevent cold symptoms, some studies have indicated it can shorten the lifespan of a cold. Plus, it boosts your overall health, including your immune system.\\n\\nAustin recommends getting the vitamin through your diet. The fresher the food, the better. Think of oranges rather than orange juice or supplements. Overdoing it on vitamin C supplements (not dietary vitamin C) can lead to [upset stomach](https://www.piedmont.org/living-real-change/10-tips-for-a-healthier-gut) and [kidney stones](https://www.piedmont.org/living-real-change/what-is-a-kidney-stone).\\n\\n**Sleep**\\n\\n\"It\\'s so important to get plenty of rest during cold and [flu season](https://www.piedmont.org/living-real-change/what-to-do-if-you-get-the-flu),\" Austin says.\\n\\nSleep helps your immune system function at its best to ward off nasty viruses and bacteria.\\n\\n**Honey and tea**\\n\\n\"I\\'m a [honey](https://www.piedmont.org/living-real-change/the-health-benefits-of-honey-1) fanatic,\" she says. \"It has natural antiviral and antimicrobial properties.\"\\n\\nAdd the natural sweetener (opt for a local variety when possible) to a cup of ginger or cinnamon [tea](https://www.piedmont.org/living-real-change/why-tea-is-good-for-your-health) to relieve a scratchy throat and stay hydrated.\\n\\n**Chicken soup**\\n\\nSometimes, Mom really does know best! Hot liquids, such as soup, help reduce mucus buildup and keep you hydrated. A study by the University of Nebraska Medical Center found chicken soup has anti-inflammatory properties, which help reduce a [cold\\'s unpleasant side effects](https://www.piedmont.org/living-real-change/when-to-see-a-doctor-for-a-cold).\\n\\n**Aromatherapy**\\n\\nRub camphor or menthol salve around – not in! – your nose to break up mucus. You can also reduce congestion by breathing in [aromatherapy oils](https://www.piedmont.org/living-real-change/health-benefits-of-essential-oils), such as peppermint and eucalyptus.\\n\\n**A steamy shower**\\n\\nAustin says a steamy shower or sauna is a great decongestant. One caveat: If you are dizzy or weak from the flu, sit in a chair in your bathroom while you run a hot shower.\\n\\n**Gargling warm salt water**\\n\\nDissolve 1/2 teaspoon of salt in a cup of warm water, then gargle to relieve [a sore throat](https://www.piedmont.org/living-real-change/is-it-a-sore-throat-or-strep).\\n\\n**Sleep with an extra pillow**\\n\\nTo help your [sinuses drain](https://www.piedmont.org/living-real-change/is-it-a-sinus-infection), sleep with an extra pillow under your head.\\n\\nNatural cold remedies to use with caution\\n-----------------------------------------\\n\\n**Nasal irrigation**\\n\\n\"Nasal irrigation can be helpful in irrigating and hydrating nasal passages so they aren\\'t dry and cracked, which can break the skin\\'s protective barrier against viruses and bacteria,\" she says. \"However, it\\'s important to do it safely. Talk to your doctor before starting nasal irrigation therapy.\"\\n\\nNever use tap water for nasal irrigation. Contaminated tap water for sinus rinsing has been linked to a rare but potentially deadly brain infection. Instead, use boiled and cooled tap water, sterile or distilled water, or saline solution.\\n\\n**Herbal supplements and vitamins**\\n\\nSome people swear by echinacea or zinc supplements, but research on their benefits is inconclusive.\\n\\n\"If you\\'re considering any alternative medicine, talk to your healthcare provider,\" Austin says. \"Vitamins and supplements are not FDA-approved and there often isn\\'t good research on their effectiveness. For a lot of people, it\\'s trial and error to find what works best.\"\\n\\nFlu shots are available at [Piedmont’s urgent care locations, primary care offices and Piedmont QuickCare at Walgreens locations](https://piedmont.org/flu).\\n\\nNeed to make an appointment with a Piedmont physician?

Cold and Flu: Home Remedies, Natural Treatments, & When to Seek Help from VirtualER\\n\\nNovember 5, 2024\\n\\nCold and Flu: Home Remedies, Natural Treatments, & When to Seek Help from VirtualER\\n===================================================================================\\n\\nBy Dr. Kevin Rankins of[Elliot Hospital](https://www.elliothospital.org/), [Elliot VirtualER](https://www.elliothospital.org/services/browse-all-services/virtualer#:~:text=The%20Elliot%E2%80%99s%20Virtual%20ER%20gives%20you%20access%20to%20the%20team), and [Elliot Urgent Care](https://www.elliothospital.org/locations/elliot-urgent-care-rivers-edge)\\n\\nCold and flu season can be challenging, but you don’t always have to rely on medications. Simple, natural remedies can help relieve symptoms and support recovery. Knowing when to seek medical help is also crucial, especially for more severe cases. Here’s a guide to effective home remedies, natural treatments, and the signs that indicate it’s time to schedule a visit with [Elliot VirtualER](https://www.elliothospital.org/services/browse-all-services/virtualer#:~:text=The%20Elliot%E2%80%99s%20Virtual%20ER%20gives%20you%20access%20to%20the%20team).\\n\\n**Home remedies for cold and flu relief**\\n-----------------------------------------\\n\\n![Image 21: natural remedies for cold and flu](https://www.solutionhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cold-remedy-200x300.png)\\n\\n### Stay hydrated\\n\\n*    Drinking plenty of fluids, such as water, herbal teas, and clear broths, helps keep the throat moist and loosens mucus.\\n*    Avoid caffeine and alcohol as they can dehydrate you.\\n\\n### Rest\\n\\n*   Giving your body the time it needs to recover is important. Rest allows your immune system to fight off the infection more effectively.\\n\\n### Steam inhalation\\n\\n*   Inhaling steam can help ease congestion. You can do this by filling a bowl with hot water, covering your head with a towel, and breathing in the steam. Using a vaporizer is another effective way to inhale steam safely.\\n*   Adding eucalyptus oil in the water may provide additional relief.\\n\\n### Saltwater gargle\\n\\n*   Gargling with warm salt water can reduce throat discomfort and swelling. Mix half a teaspoon of salt in a cup of warm water and gargle several times a day.\\n\\n### Honey and lemon\\n\\n*   Honey has natural antibacterial properties and can soothe a sore throat. Mixing it with lemon provides extra vitamin C. Add a spoonful of honey and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice to warm water for a comforting drink.\\n*   Note: Avoid giving honey to children under one year old due to the risk of botulism.\\n\\n### Ginger tea\\n\\n*    Ginger has anti-inflammatory properties that may help relieve a sore throat and reduce inflammation. Boil fresh ginger slices in water for a few minutes and add honey for sweetness.\\n\\n### Chicken soup\\n\\n*   Chicken soup can help ease cold and flu symptoms by providing warmth and hydration, which soothes the throat and loosens congestion. The nutrients from the broth, vegetables, and protein also support the immune system and promote recovery.\\n\\n[Learn More About Elliot VIrtualER or Book an Appointment](https://www.elliothospital.org/services/browse-all-services/virtualer#:~:text=The%20Elliot%E2%80%99s%20Virtual%20ER%20gives%20you%20access%20to%20the%20team)\\n\\n**Natural treatments to boost immunity**\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\n### Vitamin C![Image 22: vitamin c for cold and flu](https://www.solutionhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cold-remedy-1-200x300.png)\\n\\n*   Citrus fruits, berries, and leafy greens are rich in vitamin C, which can support your immune system. Consider vitamin C supplements if you cannot get enough through your diet.\\n\\n### Zinc supplements\\n\\n*   Zinc is probably your best bet for fighting off a cold. It can reduce the severity and duration of cold symptoms. You can find it in lozenges or natural sources like nuts, seeds, and meat.\\n*   Remember that zinc can cause nausea, which may be alleviated by taking it with food and cutting the dose. More is not better—try to stay under 20 mg daily.\\n\\n### Elderberry syrup\\n\\n*   Elderberry is known for its antiviral properties and may reduce cold and flu symptoms. It’s available as a syrup or supplement but consult a healthcare provider before using it.\\n\\n### Garlic\\n\\n*   Garlic contains compounds that boost the immune system. Adding it to your meals or taking garlic supplements can be beneficial.\\n\\n**When to seek medical help**\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nHome remedies can be effective for mild cold and flu symptoms, but sometimes medical care is necessary.\\n\\n![Image 23](https://www.elliothospital.org/application/files/8417/3082/6768/Home_remedies_can_be_effective_for_mild_cold_and_flu_symptoms_but_sometimes_medical_care_is_necessary._Heres_when_to_seek_help_High_fever_If_your_fever_reaches_103_Fahrenheit__39.4_Celsius__or_higher_contact_.png)\\n\\n**Elliot VirtualER can help with cold and flu**\\n-----------------------------------------------\\n\\n[Elliot VirtualER](https://www.elliothospital.org/services/browse-all-services/virtualer#:~:text=The%20Elliot%E2%80%99s%20Virtual%20ER%20gives%20you%20access%20to%20the%20team) provides convenient access to healthcare professionals without leaving your home.

Greenman, Integrative Medicine\\n\\n[BACK TO BLOG](https://www.stamfordhealth.org/healthflash-blog)\\n\\n![Image 11: SH](https://assets.stamfordhealth.org/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:good,dpr_auto,c_auto,g_auto/Cinnamon?h=342&iar=0&w=500)\\n\\n*   facebook\\n*   twitter\\n*   linkedin\\n*   [email](mailto:)\\n\\nBy Dr. Danielle E. Greenman, Integrative Medicine\\n\\n### Learn More about Integrative Medicine Services\\n\\nWe\\'re here to help. If you have questions or need assistance, call 203.276.4777.\\n\\n Type 2 diabetes (also called diabetes mellitus) results from the perfect storm of not enough movement, too much of the wrong foods, emotional stress, lack of sleep, toxins, and genetics. More often than not, patients with type 2 diabetes look towards natural medicine in addition to their conventional medicine for help in treating their disease. Natural medicines and using food as medicine is a wonderful way to complement your diabetes treatment. However, if added without the correct knowledge or guidance, mixing herbs, supplements and medicines can lead to a drop in blood sugar called hypoglycemia.\\n\\n While I do not recommend starting any new treatments without consulting your health care provider, below find a list of my top natural remedies for type 2 diabetes.\\n\\n**1. Apple Cider Vinegar**\\n\\n The primary compound in ACV is acetic acid and is believed to be responsible for many of its health benefits. There are many evidence-based approaches to using ACV. Taking 2 tablespoons before bedtime can reduce your morning fasting sugar levels. Even better, 1-2 tablespoons of ACV taken with meals can decrease the glycemic load of a carbohydrate rich meal. I generally tell patients to either consume ACV alone, prior to a meal or mix it into salad dressings or teas.\\n\\n**2. Fiber and Barley**\\n\\n Eating fiber decreases blood sugar and insulin concentrations. The recommended amount of fiber is around 30 grams per day. Most Americans get around 6-8 grams, which is not nearly enough. While you can take fiber supplements like Metamucil (psylium husk), the best way to reach your goal is to eat your veggies! Barley is a high-fiber, high-protein grain which has lots of data to support its role in helping improve blood sugar, insulin, cholesterol and general inflammation. Barley does not requiring soaking and usually can cook in less than 15 minutes on the stove top with just some water and salt.\\n\\n**3. Chromium**\\n\\n Mainly found in brewer’s yeast, deficiency in chromium impairs the metabolism of glucose. Evidence supports chromium for lower blood sugar and A1c levels. Be careful if you have kidney disease with this supplement.\\n\\n**4. Zinc**\\n\\n Those with diabetes are commonly found to be zinc deficient. Studies have shown zinc supplementation can reduce blood sugar and A1C, have an antioxidant effect, lower blood sugar and even help treat some of the complications related to diabetes. Large doses of zinc can inhibit the absorption of other minerals like copper, so be sure to ask for guidance of the appropriate dosing.\\n\\n**5. Aloe Vera**\\n\\n The sap of aloe vera is known for its laxative effect. Therefore, make sure to get the juice of the gel! There is increasing evidence for use of the gel, which is the mucilaginous material inside the leaves. Be sure that any product you buy is free of aloin or anthraquinones to avoid finding yourself in the bathroom!\\n\\n**6. Berberine**\\n\\n This is one of my all-time favorite botanicals found in plants such as goldenseal, barberry, Oregon grape root and Coptis. Current evidence supports its use for decreasing blood sugar and hba1c. Be aware that this herb can interfere with metabolism of traditional pharmaceuticals and should never be taken while pregnant.\\n\\n**7. Cinnamon**\\n\\n A medically beneficial indulgence to help lower your blood sugar and cholesterol levels.\\n\\n**8. Fenugreek**\\n\\n A seed commonly used as a food spice has been used abroad for centuries for its medical benefits to lower cholesterol and hba1c. If your urine smells like maple syrup, not to worry, this is a known side effect and is harmless.\\n\\n**9. Gymnema**\\n\\n Used for centuries in India, evidence is catching up to its medical use showing benefits for glucose metabolism, insulin levels and as an adjunct to improve the results of traditional pharmaceuticals. Be aware, because this botanical works synergistically with your meds, you must monitor your blood sugar closely to avoid having hypoglycemia.\\n\\n**10. Nopal**\\n\\n Ever see nopales at your favorite Mexican restaurant? Now you can order them and, rest assured, you’re choosing a food that help lower your blood sugar. Nopales are the pads of the prickly pear cactus and when cooked right are _delicious_! I personally like eating them with eggs or as a salad.\\n\\n_Please remember: this list of herbs is not medical advice and should not be taken unless advised by a healthcare provider._\\n\\n### Featured Expert/ Author\\n\\n[Dr. Danielle E.
